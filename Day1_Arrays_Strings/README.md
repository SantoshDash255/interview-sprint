# 📅 Day 1 — Arrays, Strings, and Debugging

### 🎯 Goal
Strengthen string manipulation, slicing, and basic algorithm logic.

---

### 🧪 Tasks Completed
- Practiced slicing: `[::-1]`, `[::]`, `[:n]`
- Debugged frequency counter code (`unique_letters`)
- Enhanced logic with conditions and sorting
- Solved array/string problems similar to:
  - Reverse a string
  - Remove duplicates
  - Sort characters by frequency

---

### 🧠 Learnings
- How slicing works in Python
- Using dictionaries to count character frequency
- Sorting dictionaries by values with `sorted()` and `lambda`
- Clean debugging approach

---

### ✅ Outcome
Understood key array/string concepts and completed LeetCode-style exercises for these topics.
