# 🧩 Day 1 – Arrays & Strings + Mini Project

### 📘 Overview
First milestone in the Interview Sprint — focused on Python lists, strings, slicing, and foundational problem-solving patterns. Built small tasks, debug challenges, and a full mini-project.

---

### 💻 Key Learnings
- Reversing arrays & strings using slicing and `reverse()`
- List comprehensions for transformation
- String operations: `split()`, `join()`, and counting occurrences
- Dictionary usage for frequency counting
- Debugging `=+` vs `+=` logical bugs

---

### ⚙️ Mini Project – Text Transformer CLI
Interactive command-line Python app with:
- Sentence reversal  
- Reverse word order  
- Reverse each word individually  
- Character frequency counter  
- Duplicate word removal  

Wrapped in a clean `main()` function for reusability and clarity.

### 🧠 Reflection
> “Learned to move from syntax to structured thinking — building real, modular code instead of one-liners.”

### 🚀 Next Up
**Day 2:** Dive into HashMaps, Sets, Counters, and build the *HashMap Visualizer* Flask app.
